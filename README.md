### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-  Iâ€™m currently working on organizing all my collected knowledge / information using Obsidian
-  Iâ€™m currently learning both Obsidian and Git
-  Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate because I couldn't help anyone. I'm a unranked amateur coder.
-  Iâ€™m looking for help with â€¦ life. But who isn't?
-  Ask me about my fiction (or tell me about your creations of any kind)
-  How to reach me: I thought this was obvious? @ViktorSirin, right?
-  Pronouns: he/him
-  Fun fact: learned how to throw a knuckleball (badly) from a man who pitched to Babe Ruth (yes, I'm that old)
